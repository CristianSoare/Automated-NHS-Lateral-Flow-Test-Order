# Automated-NHS-Lateral-Flow-Test-Order

This is my first project in automation using selenium.

Please do not abuse it's use.

Intended initially to help people with no knowledge of technology and web navigation automate their lateral flow test orders without clogging up the NHS COVID line.

I have included at various points input validation to try minimise the error margin.
